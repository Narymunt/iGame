About Holograms

2002
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea of the demogroup is from two roommates in the College of Dunaújváros in
the spring of 2002. The daydreamers start programming with less experiances but
with more pleasure. They try it first in Pascal, but as aha has no idea about
programming, jumper has to teach him. (thank you jumper) They skip the
"Hello World" programs and start to rotate WireFrame cubes. They have the chance
to show their first programs to the Fresh!Mindworkz demogroup. The guys decision
that they will work in OpenGL is due to pasy. From this time the way of
Holograms is aligned by the wonderful fresh trio. (pasy, pontscho, remage)

2003
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One night, the group try to make their program work in Delphi. At dawn, the 
first 3DS max exporter reader is born which is not a demo yet, but already sets 
the basics which the group can build on. In Autumn, the Holograms releases
its first demo in dunaújváros, on the Resource Demo Show. That's their homework 
for the computer graphics lesson at the same time.

2004 - 2005
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aha desides to write his diplome work about computer graphics, so in the demos 
of Holograms the shots for the diplome work can be seen from 2004 to 2005. 
The programming language changes from Object Pascal to C++ and hard
coding changes to parametic solution as well. By the end of 2005 comes out a 
demand to set new basics for the Holograms engine.

2006
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The engine which has new basics already, fails in 2006. A script laguage is 
realised, but it has no scheme and is working pell-mell. The best evidence of 
this was the Function party of 2006. The complicated, undocumented script
throws in the towel when aha was triing to finish their demo on an unfamiliar 
keyboard of a laptop. This affair put back the release of the Holograms demo 
for 2 years.

2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2007 is the year of 1k as the Hologograms is falling apart (jumper becomes a 
family man, the college is already over) and aha try to keep alive the demogroup 
with 1k intros. At the same time he is working on the new engine.

GrEnADE 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was an old plan to create an editable demo engine. This demo is a technical
test demo for making work this new engine system. It works with the help of
project plugins, stored in XML files, visualized with OpenGL graphic API.
The aim is to reach the Grenade status, which means a Graphic Engine And Demo
Environment system. The main plan for the future is to create a visual editor.
The task of it will be the timing and to make easier the animation of the plugin
parameters. After an effective basic system will grow up, the new plan will be
to make a LINUX and MACOSX port as well.

The demo is tested on the following video cards below
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ATI HD3850
- ATI mobile X700
- NVIDIA Geforce 6600 GT
- NVIDIA Geforce 7300 GT
- NVIDIA Geforce 8800 GTS
- INTEL GMA 3100
- INTEL 82915G/GV/910GL Express Chipset
